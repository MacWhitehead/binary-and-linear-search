        In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which 
        solves the search problem. Namely, to retrieve information 
        stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search 
        space of a problem domain. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When selecting a searching algorithm, you must consider two things: 
        Time complexity (computations in terms of n)
        Data details (is it sorted, random?)
    </p>
    <p>
        Linear search is the most basic kind of search method. It checks 
        each element of the list in turn, until the desired element is 
        found. 0(n); You have to go over every item with this. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm which relies 
        on the elements in the list being **sorted**. We apply the same 
        search process to progressively smaller sub-lists of the original 
        list, starting with the whole list and approximately halving the 
        search area every time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other search types: 
        Most are similar in time and complexity to binary search and 
        depend on items in the array being sorted. 
        Jump search: check fewer elements than linear search by jumping 
        ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements. 
        Interpolation search: improvement over binary search for instances, 
        where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed. 
        Fibonacci search: comparison-based technique that uses fibonacci 
        numbers to search an element in a sorted array.
